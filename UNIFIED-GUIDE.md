- **[README.md](README.md)** — Toolkit overview, architecture, and getting started
- **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** — Installation, configuration, automation, and troubleshooting
- **[LEARNING-PLAN.md](LEARNING-PLAN.md)** — 11-level progressive mastery path
- **[AGENT-TEAMS.md](AGENT-TEAMS.md)** — Multi-agent orchestration patterns and templates

Start with the [README](README.md).
